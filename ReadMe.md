## Features

- Scrapes weather data from Google
- Extracts current weather condition, temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and more information URL
- Returns weather data in a greet sentence format

## Usage/Examples
To run the script, simply execute the Python file using your preferred Python interpreter. For example:

```python
python Google_Weather.py
```

This will prompt you to enter the location you want to check the weather for. For example:

```python
if __name__=="__main__":
    weather = Google_Weather_Scrapper("New York")
    # Access the weather data
    print(f"Location: {weather.location}")
    print(f"Time: {weather.time}")
    print(f"Condition: {weather.condition}")
    print(f"Temperature (Celsius): {weather.temperature_celsius}")
    print(f"Temperature (Fahrenheit): {weather.temperature_fahrenheit}")
    print(f"Precipitation: {weather.precipitation}")
    print(f"Humidity: {weather.humidity}")
    print(f"Wind Speed: {weather.wind_speed}")

Output:
Location: New York, NY, USA
Time: Tuesday, 12:00â€¯am
Condition: Cloudy
Temperature (Celsius): 21
Temperature (Fahrenheit): 69
Precipitation: 6%
Humidity: 54%
